Module 6 Python API Challenge

## Project Overview
Using the OpenWeatherMap API and my knowledge of Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals, I explored what weather changes occur as we approach the equator. I examined how weather in the Northern Hemisphere differs from that in the Southern Hemisphere.

## Analysis

Temperature vs. Latitude
* In the Northern Hemisphere, temperature and latitude are negatively correlated. This means that the temperature decreases as the latitude rises. This makes sense since the higher you you go, the lower the temp tends to be. The opposite can be said for the southern hemisphere, which shows a positive correlation between temperature and latitude. You can see from the graph that as the latitide increases, so do the temperatures.

Humidity vs. Latitude
* There does not seem to be a strong relationship between humidity and latitude, either in the southern hemisphere or the northern one.

Cloudiness vs. Latitude
* In the northern hemisphere, there does not seem to be a strong correlation between cloudiness and latitude. Howevew, in the southern hemisphere there does appear to be a weak negative correlation between cloudiness and latitide, as cloudiness decreases a bit as the latitide increases.

Wind Speed vs. Latitude
* Neither the southern or northern hemisphere show a strong correlation between wind speed and latitude.
